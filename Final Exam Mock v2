I.	Cyber Rovers is an IT consulting company specialized in delivering small to medium software projects related to cyber security. Due to an increase in shift of a large number of companies from a traditional software methodologies such as water fall toward agile software practices, Cyber Rovers recently has decided to try Scrum (a widely used agile framework) for the first time. Currently, they have a new project and plan to use Scrum in this project. Based on the above description, answer questions 1 to 3 below.


1.	D Do you advise them to obtain Scrum training first before they adopt the Scrum framework? Choose the best answer.

A.	No, because Scrum is easy to implement, they don’t need the training
B.	No, as long as they have the project manager, it is easier for them to adopt Scrum by themselves without wasting resources.    
C.	Yes, unless they get the training, they are not allowed to implement the Scrum framework
D.	Yes, unless they get the training, it is difficult to follow the Scrum process 

2.	C Do they need to discuss their intent with the customers and receive their approval to adopt Scrum before they start the project?

A.	No, I don’t advise this because it is acceptable nowadays to use Scrum 
B.	Yes, because it increases their ROI (Return On Investment)  
C.	Yes, because it changes their delivery method 
D.	No, because it is up to them to decide whether to use the Scrum framework or not 

3.	C They are planning to assign either Jessica or David for the role of Scrum Master. David doesn’t know Scrum, but has eight years of experience in managing IT projects. Jessica knows Scrum very well, but she’s very young and has no real world experience. Which one is a better choice for the role of Scrum Master? 

A.	David, because he knows project management and doesn’t have to know Scrum

7.	C Who should estimate the volume of work of each backlog item? 

A.	Product Owner, because s/he has the full responsibility for the Product Backlog, and knows the items more than others 
B.	Scrum Master, because s/he’s responsible for planning 
C.	Development Team members, because they are supposed to do the work and they know best how much work is required to complete each item 
D.	none

A.	Refer the representative to the Product Owner to discuss it 
B.	Refer the representative to the Scrum Master to discuss it 
C.	Refuse it, because they are in the middle of the Sprint 
D.	Accept it only if they are willing to ask for it formally 

IV.	The Sprint time is going to end. Off the 6 items in the Sprint Backlog, only one is completely finished, three items are almost finished, and others are just 50% complete. Based on the above description, answer 13 to 16 questions below.

13.	A  Who has the authority to cancel a Sprint? 

A.	Product Owner 
B.	Scrum Master 
C.	Development Team

A.	All three roles are responsible 
B.	Two of the Development Team members that were sick for a number of days during the Sprint are responsible 
C.	Product Owner has the primary responsibility 
D.	B & C



V.	The first Sprint is done and the second Sprint has started with 6 items worth 50 points. They are in the middle of the Sprint, no items are finished yet, and they are worried that they cannot develop enough items in this Sprint either. Based on the above description, answer 17 to 19 questions below.


17.	A When is a Sprint over? 

A.	When the time-box expires 
B.	When the Product Manager says so 
C.	When the Scrum Master says so 
D.	When the Sprint Backlog is all developed 

18.	A They believe that it’s a good choice to have a day off after the first Sprint (for education, research, and to see what other development teams are doing), but the company does not accept it. Who should discuss it with the company and try to get their approval? 

A.	 Product Manager 
B.	 Scrum Master 
C.	 Development Team 
D.	 All three roles 

19.	B Unfinished items of the previous Sprint (5 items out of 6) are returned to the Product Backlog.

Model View Controller (MVC) is a popular software development architecture that isolates the application logic from the user interface layer and supports separation of roles among the application components. The model directly interacts with database/file and responsible for managing the data. On the other hand, the view is responsible for providing an interface to the user, which allows it to accept user input and/or presents data to the user. As the name indicates, the controller is responsible for managing interaction between the view and the model.
As part of your final exam, a list of requirements are given below:
1.	Post new job for job seekers
2.	Purchase a student parking permit
3.	Request absence excuse 
4.	Register as UNG alumni
5.	Subscribe for UNG newsletter 
•	Select one from the above requirements to implement using the MVC architecture. First, create one or more user stories from the selected requirements. Based on the user story, create a set of task/s to implement. The task you choose should be big enough to contain a view, a model, and a controller. In your implementation, a model should contain at least one class, non-default constructor, instance variables, and all the getter and setter methods. A view (most probably an fxml file) should contain the hierarchy of container/s and controls (assume all the imports and the fxml headers are included). You should map the controller class inside your container tag (for instance, fx:controller= ”application.Maincontroller”). In addition, each control should have an fx:id, and a method name if it triggers some action (for instance, onAction="#handleButton").  Create a controller class which should contain the functionality to interact with the database. The following are some of the constructors and methods for FXMLLoader class.
