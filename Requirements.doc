Wilderness weather station

The government of a country with large areas of wilderness decides to deploy several hundred weather stations in remote areas.
Weather stations collect data from a set of instruments that measure temperature and pressure, sunshine, rainfall, wind speed and wind direction.The weather station includes a number of instruments that measure weather parameters such as the wind speed and direction, the ground and air temperatures, the barometric pressure and the rainfall over a 24-hour period. Each of these instruments is controlled by a software system that takes parameter readings periodically and manages the data collected from the instruments.

Weather subsystems
The weather station system
	This is responsible for collecting weather data, carrying out some initial data processing and transmitting it to the data management system.

The data management and archiving system
	This system collects the data from all of the wilderness weather stations, carries out data processing and analysis and archives the data.

The station maintenance system
	This system can communicate by satellite with all wilderness weather stations to monitor the health of these systems and provide reports of problems.
