//This is the hash function you requested
private static int hashPass(String password) {
        int hash = 7;
        for (int i = 0; i < password.length(); i++) {
            hash = hash*31 + password.charAt(i);
        }
        return hash;
    }
    
    You can look at the DBconnector in my branch in kyles playground if you want to see how I connect to the DB and 
    what methods we already have. The format for the user table is currently:
    
    userID, privilege, username, password
    
    Current and only user
    userID: 1
    privilege: 1
    username: Admin
    password: "password", but this is hashed to 1449706402, which is what we store in the DB
    
    I will upload the whole thing when I have time. It still has a lot of stuff that I am working on fixing
    and i think it would be more confusing for you to look at it unfinished. 
    
    Need to get some sleep before I go to work tonight.
